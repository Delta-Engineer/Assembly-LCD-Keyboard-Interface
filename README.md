# Assembly-LCD-Keyboard-Interface
This is a program that uses a keyboard (keyboard has values of hex, so 0-F are the hot keys) to communicate with LCD using serial communication, this project is for educational purposes, use it as you wishâ€¦

# Getting Started
To get started make sure that you have MPLAB installed, and are using PIC18F4520 microcontroller. Etiher export the entire project or export the 
'LCD-Keyboard-Interface.asm'

# Prerequisites
The IDE to download the code to the PIC microcontroller is MPLAB

# Installing
Download the IDE at: 'https://www.microchip.com/mplab/mplab-x-ide'

# Exporting project
If you have the IDE setup, either export the entire github project and use it on the IDE, or 
create your own project folder and add to the project folder 'LCD-Keyboard-Interface.asm'

# Built With
MPLAB - The IDE used
PIC18F4520 - The microcontroller used

# Versioning
